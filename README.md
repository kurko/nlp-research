# NLU research

This codebase has a few projects researching different aspects of NLP and how
to plug it into functions via AI/basic algorithms. Each directory is a different
project.

### nlu-timeline framework

Everything happens in regards to time. Every-little-things. This framework
creates a framework to replace basic variables so that we can go back in time
and reason about things in relation to what once wasn't.

### fundamental-conceptualization

Assumes fundamental, physical position and movements as meaning for higher-level
concepts.

### nlu-generalization

Takes a sentence such as `$10 in restaurant`, converts to a generalized token
sequence such as `[type:dollar] [type:direction] [type:category]`.

### nlu-organization

**DEPRECATED:** it won't be developed for now because a child doesn't try to
figure out what is the verb and etc.

Figures out what's the structure of the sentence.
